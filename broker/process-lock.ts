/**
 * Try once, without waiting, to exclusively own a local directory for this process.
 * Creates the directory if necessary. Retain the lease until all protected work ends;
 * a lease does not keep Node's event loop alive. Errors other than lock contention
 * throw (including unsupported native binaries, kernels, or filesystem locking).
 *
 * Protocol: open a permanent `.process.lock` without truncation, request an exclusive
 * whole-file kernel lock, and only then publish a separate diagnostic JSON file.
 * No data operations touch the locked file (Windows forbids truncation under lock).
 * The descriptor
 * remains private and open for the lease lifetime. Release unlocks/closes only that
 * descriptor and never removes or renames the file. A losing attempt only closes its
 * own descriptor. Thus simultaneous starts have one winner, paused owners retain
 * ownership indefinitely, and process death releases ownership without PID checks,
 * age expiry, stale-file deletion, or an unlink/recreate ABA race. Node opens the
 * descriptor close-on-exec; ordinary spawned children do not inherit the lease.
 *
 * Supported by fs-native-extensions on macOS (flock), Linux >=3.15 (OFD fcntl locks),
 * and Windows (LockFileEx), with its available Node prebuilds. This is a cooperative
 * LOCAL lock, not a network-filesystem/distributed lock or a security boundary.
 * All participants must use this primitive in the same stable, trusted directory.
 * Do not unlink/rename/replace the lock file or its directory, even while apparently
 * idle: another process can already have opened it. External directory cleanup,
 * non-cooperating writers, explicit descriptor inheritance, and native fork without
 * exec are outside this contract. Unsupported locks fail rather than use a TTL.
